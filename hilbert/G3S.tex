\section{Input Node: The Discrete Energy Functional}
The continuum action $\Acal[\U]$ is the smooth limit of the discrete action $\Acalh[\Uh]$, whose stationarity yields the discrete Euler-Lagrange equation $\DeltaFourh \Uh = 0$.

\section{Theorem: The Kinematic Closure Chain (G3.Chain)}

\begin{theorem}[Discrete Kinematic Convergence]
The discrete Euler-Lagrange operator converges to the continuous solution:
\[
\DeltaFourh \Uh = 0 \quad \implies \quad \lim_{\mesh\to 0} \frac{\DeltaFourh \Uh}{\mesh^2} = \DFour.
\]
\end{theorem}

\section*{G3: Discrete–Continuum Reciprocity}

\paragraph{Summary.}
The validation of this module confirms the self-consistent closure chain by asserting that the discrete scheme accurately reflects the continuum system:
$$\GThreeStatement.$$

\paragraph{Compatibility with conservation (index-free).}
The validity of the discrete scheme hinges on its use of a pairing ($\Bform(\cdot,\cdot)$ or $\Bformh(\cdot,\cdot)$) that ensures **reciprocity** holds for the field $\U$.
This reciprocity guarantees that the conservation law derived from Noether's theorem is preserved across the numerical limit. Specifically, the abstract conservation current $\Current$ must satisfy:
\[
\Div{\Current} = 0,
\]
and this identity is invariant under the continuous interpolation and discrete sampling defined by the core reciprocity pairing. The consistent convergence of the field $\U$ means that the continuity laws for $\StressEnergy$ are preserved.

\paragraph{Comment.}
The convergence proof ensures that the flow of distinguishability—the source of $\StressEnergy$ and $\Current$—is numerically stable and topologically invariant as the mesh $\mesh \to 0$. This sets the necessary foundation for subsequent derivations of metric structure and field dynamics.
