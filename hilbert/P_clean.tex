\begin{abstract}
This document synthesizes the core closure arguments (G1--G4). It shows that the foundational axiom of \textbf{Minimal Informational Curvature} (\texorpdfstring{\StrongForm}{U^{(4)}=0}) supplies the structural hypothesis necessary to derive the \textbf{Conservation of Stress--Energy} (\texorpdfstring{\ConcludeDivT}{div T = 0}), which rigorously enforces the \textbf{Second Law of Causal Order} (\GOneStatement) as a theorem of monotonicity. The full system is constrained by \textbf{Discrete--Continuum Reciprocity} (\GThreeStatement) and the \textbf{Causal Data Processing Inequality} (\GFourDPI), ensuring the integrity of measurement and prediction.

\section{The Axiomatic Chain: Order Implies Dynamics}\label{sec:arc}

The argument's structure is a single dependency chain, demonstrating that physical laws emerge from consistency:
\[
  \StrongForm \quad \xrightarrow{\text{G4S: Noether Bridge}} \quad \ConcludeDivT \quad \xrightarrow{\text{G1S: Constraint}} \quad \GOneStatement.
\]

\section{Core Contracts and Closure Arguments}

\subsection{Kinematic Closure and Reciprocity (G2)}\label{sec:g2}

The unique analytic closure for the admissible history \(\U\) minimizes the Informational Curvature Action, leading to the \textbf{Kinematic Closure} strong form and its necessary reciprocal constraint.

\paragraph{Strong Closure.} The minimization yields the Euler–Lagrange equation:
\[
  \StrongForm.
\]

\paragraph{Weak Reciprocity.} This closure is equivalent to the \textbf{Weak Reciprocity Form}, which utilizes the symmetric, coercive bilinear form \(\Bform\):
\[
  \WeakForm.
\]

\subsection{Conservation and Discrete Consistency (G3/G4S)}\label{sec:g34}

The stability established in G2 provides the foundation for all conservation laws, verified across the continuous and discrete domains.

\paragraph{Discrete Consistency (G3).} The discrete kinematic problem is proven to be stable and consistent, ensuring that the smooth analytic solution is the unique limit of finite measurement processes, fulfilling the contract:
\[
  \GThreeStatement.
\]

\paragraph{Noether Conservation (G4S).} The stationarity from G2 is the hypothesis for Noether's Theorem. Translational symmetry (\(\Xi\)) generates the conserved \textbf{Stress--Energy Tensor} (\(\StressEnergy\)):
\[
  \ConcludeDivT.
\]

\subsection{Thermodynamic and Statistical Closure (G1/G5)}\label{sec:g15}

The conserved structure provides the constraints necessary for the final laws governing distinguishability and predictability.

\paragraph{Thermodynamic Closure (G1).} The conservation of order enforces that every admissible causal refinement (\(\mathcal{C}_{n} \to \mathcal{C}_{n+1}\)) cannot decrease the set of distinguishable micro-orderings (\(\Omega(\mathcal{C})\)), proving the \textbf{Second Law of Causal Order}:
\[
  \GOneStatement.
\]

\paragraph{Statistical Closure (G5) (one-paragraph seed).}
Admissible coarse-grainings consistent with \(\C\) cannot increase distinguishability and the score is unbiased at truth; together with conservation, these facts pin down which summaries remain stable and how much prediction is possible:
\[
  \GFourDPI \qquad\text{and}\qquad \GFourScoreZero .
\]
Conservation links symmetry to stability,
\[
  \ConcludeDivT \;\Longrightarrow\; \text{stability of } \Invariant{\Xi},
\]
so any remaining structure is captured as constrained noise \(\Res\), and predictability is bounded by the invariant geometry implied by these closures.
