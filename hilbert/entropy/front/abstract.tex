We present a set of axioms governing the correspondence of measurements
required for a universe to reach coherent conclusions about its own history.
Every measurement produces a finite, distinguishable event, and every
admissible extension of the measurement record must maintain global
consistency without introducing unrecorded structure.  These consistency
requirements force discrete observational data to refine in a unique,
information--minimizing way that converges to smooth, spline--level
dynamics.  The Galerkin projection provides the canonical mechanism by which
the required splines are selected as minimizers of an informational action.

Classical differential equations, Hilbert--space structures, gauge symmetries,
curvature, transport laws, and geometric tensors emerge only when the
measurement record permits a smooth, globally consistent completion; none are
postulated \emph{a priori}.

The resulting framework reproduces waves, matter flow, diffusion, advection,
geodesic motion, quantization, curvature, and field--theoretic phenomena from
the axioms alone.  Most importantly, the axioms entail---as a theorem---that
entropy cannot decrease:
\[
\Delta S \ge 0.
\]
No statistical or thermodynamic assumptions are invoked.
