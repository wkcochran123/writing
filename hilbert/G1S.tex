\section{Axiomatic Foundation: Causal Order and Entropy}

The analysis begins with the locally finite causal order $\C$ of distinguishable events, whose structure is preserved by the Axiom of Event Selection (Martin-like consistency).

\begin{definition}[Causal Entropy $\Entropy$]
The $\mathbf{Entropy}$ associated with a causal set $\C$ is defined via the number of admissible micro-orderings, $\Omega(\C)$:
\[
\Entropy[\C] = k_{\mathrm{B}} \ln |\Omega(\C)|.
\]
$\Entropy$ quantifies the number of distinct internal configurations consistent with the field $\U$.
\end{definition}

\section{Theorem: The Second Law of Causal Order (\GOneStatement)}

\begin{theorem}[Monotonicity of Causal Entropy]
In any admissible extension of a finite causal order, the count of distinguishable states cannot decrease.
$$\GOneStatement.$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\textbf{G1 Proof Obligation Fulfillment}]
Let $\C_n$ be a causal set and $\C_{n+1}$ be an admissible refinement. By the Axiom of Event Selection, the set of admissible orderings is monotonically non-decreasing:
$$
\Omega(\C_n) \subseteq \Omega(\C_{n+1}).
$$
Taking the logarithm yields the constraint on the informational field $\U$:
$$
\Entropy[\C_{n+1}] - \Entropy[\C_n] = \Delta \Entropy \ge 0.
$$
The non-decreasing nature of $\Entropy$ is a theorem of order consistency, establishing thermodynamic closure.
\end{proof}
