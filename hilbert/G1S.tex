\section{Axiomatic Foundation: Causal Order and Event Selection}

The proof begins by grounding the concepts of entropy and distinction within ZFC set theory, as outlined in \texttt{P.tex}[cite: 202, 211].

\begin{definition}[Causal Set and Admissible Micro-Orderings]
Let $\C$ be the causal set of distinguishable events accessible to an observer[cite: 881, 1004]. Let $\Omega(\C)$ be the set of all **admissible micro-orderings** of those events consistent with the Axiom of Event Selection (Martin-like consistency)[cite: 81, 881, 1328].
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Causal Entropy $\Entropy$]
The $\mathbf{Entropy}$ associated with a causal set $\C$ is the logarithm of this count, where $\kB$ is Boltzmann's constant:
\[
\Entropy[\C] = \kB \ln |\Omega(\C)|.
\]
Operationally, $\Entropy$ measures the number of distinct internal configurations that yield the same observable causal invariants[cite: 883].
\end{definition}

\section{Theorem: The Second Law of Causal Order $(\GOneStatement)$}

The principle that information, and thus entropy, can never decrease is proved as a theorem of causal consistency rather than assumed as a postulate[cite: 78, 79].

\begin{theorem}[Monotonicity of Causal Entropy $\mathbf{(\GOneStatement)}$]
In any extension of a finite causal order that remains globally consistent (via Event Selection/Martin-like consistency), the count of distinguishable states cannot decrease.
\[
\GOneStatement.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\textbf{G1 Proof Obligation Fulfillment}]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Causal Refinement:} Let $\C_n$ be a causal set, and $\C_{n+1}$ be an admissible extension (refinement) that introduces new distinctions while remaining consistent with the Axiom of Event Selection[cite: 1306]. By definition, $\C_n \subseteq \C_{n+1}$.
    \item \textbf{Monotonicity of $\Omega$:} Since the refinement preserves the partial order and is globally consistent, every micro-ordering that was admissible in $\C_n$ must remain admissible in $\C_{n+1}$[cite: 92]. Therefore, the set of admissible orderings cannot shrink:
    $$
    \Omega(\C_n) \subseteq \Omega(\C_{n+1}).
    $$
    \item \textbf{Logarithmic Closure:} Taking the natural logarithm and multiplying by $\kB$:
    $$
    \kB \ln |\Omega(\C_n)| \le \kB \ln |\Omega(\C_{n+1})|.
    $$
    \item \textbf{Conclusion (Entropy Invariance):} This directly implies that the entropy is non-decreasing[cite: 1307, 1308]:
    $$
    \Entropy[\C_{n+1}] - \Entropy[\C_n] = \Delta \Entropy \ge 0.
    $$
\end{enumerate}
The equality holds only if the refinement $\C_{n+1}$ does not expose any previously indistinguishable configurations. Thus, the Arrow of Time is a theorem of order monotonicity[cite: 93].
\end{proof}
