\section{Input Node: Stationarity from G2}

The conservation law rests on the action principle. From the **Kinematic Closure** (G2), the admissible history $\U$ satisfies the stationarity condition, $\deltaVar \Scal = 0$.

\begin{definition}[Action Functional]
The action functional $\Scal[\U]$ is the integral of the local Lagrangian density $\Lcal$ that encodes informational curvature:
\[
\Scal[\U] = \int \Lcal(\U, \grad \U, g)\, d\tau.
\]
\end{definition}

\section{Conservation as Translational Symmetry}

Conservation of energy and momentum is a direct consequence of the field $\U$ being invariant under translations.

\begin{theorem}[Noether's Theorem (Abstract Form)]
For every continuous symmetry $\Xi$ that leaves the action $\Scal$ invariant ($\deltaVar \Scal = 0$), there exists a conserved current $\Current$ such that the divergence vanishes:
\[
\Div{\Current} = 0.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\textbf{G4 Proof Obligation Fulfillment (Translational Invariance)}]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis (G2 Closure):} The field $\U$ is a stationary point of $\Scal$ ($\deltaVar \Scal = 0$), a condition guaranteed by the **Kinematic Closure** $\GTwoStatement$.
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} We consider the continuous translational symmetry, $\Xi^{\text{trans}}$, which leaves the underlying structure of $\U$ unchanged.
    \item \textbf{Current Derivation (API Call):} The abstract Noether current associated with translational symmetry is the **Stress-Energy Tensor**, $\StressEnergy$. This tensor is constructed by the abstract API primitive:
    \[
      \StressEnergy \leftarrow \NoetherTensor{\Lcal}{\U}{\Xi^{\text{trans}}}.
    \]
    \item \textbf{Divergence Identity:} Applying the Noether identity to this current yields the conservation law for energy and momentum:
    \[
      \Div{\StressEnergy} = 0.
    \]
\end{enumerate}
The **Noether bridge** is complete: the kinematic closure is the logical engine that produces the conserved current required for dynamics.
\end{proof}

\section{Output Node: Chain Completion}

The derived conservation law, $\Div{\StressEnergy} = 0$, is the necessary intermediate structural constraint that links the local analytical consistency ($\GTwoStatement$) to the final **global thermodynamic consistency** ($\GOneStatement$).
The logical proof chain is now ready for its final step.
